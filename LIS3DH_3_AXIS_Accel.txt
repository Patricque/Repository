Use this wiring if you want to connect via I2C interface

- Connect Vin to the power supply, 3-5V is fine. (red wire on STEMMA QT version) Use the same voltage that the microcontroller logic is based off of. For most Arduinos, that is 5V
- Connect GND to common power/data ground (black wire on STEMMA QT version)
- Connect the SCL pin to the I2C clock SCL pin on your Arduino. (yellow wire on STEMMA QT version) On an UNO & '328 based Arduino, this is also known as A5, on a Mega it is also known as digital 21 and on a Leonardo/Micro, digital 3
- Connect the SDA pin to the I2C data SDA pin on your Arduino. (blue wire on STEMMA QT version) On an UNO & '328 based Arduino, this is also known as A4, on a Mega it is also known as digital 20 and on a Leonardo/Micro, digital 2


Since this is also an SPI-capable sensor, we can use hardware or 'software' SPI. To make wiring identical on all Arduinos, we'll begin with 'software' SPI. The following pins should be used:

- Connect Vin to the power supply, 3V or 5V is fine. Use the same voltage that the microcontroller logic is based off of. For most Arduinos, that is 5V
- Connect GND to common power/data ground
- Connect the SCL (SCK) pin to Digital #13 but any pin can be used later
- Connect the SDO pin to Digital #12 but any pin can be used later
- Connect the SDA (SDI) pin to Digital #11 but any pin can be used later
- Connect the CS pin Digital #10 but any pin can be used later


Here's an example of wiring a Feather M0 or M4 to the sensor with I2C:

- Board 3V to sensor Vin (red wire on STEMMA QT version)
- Board GND to sensor GND (black wire on STEMMA QT version)
- Board SCL to sensor SCL (yellow wire on STEMMA QT version)
- Board SDA to sensor SDA (blue wire on STEMMA QT version)
- Board D6 to sensor INT (or use any other free digital I/O pin)

And an example of a Feather M0 or M4 wired with hardware SPI:

- Board 3V to sensor Vin
- Board GND to sensor GND
- Board SCK to sensor SCL
- Board MOSI to sensor SDA
- Board MISO to sensor SDO
- Board D5 to sensor CS (or use any other free digital I/O pin)
- Board D6 to sensor INT (or use any other free digital I/O pin)
